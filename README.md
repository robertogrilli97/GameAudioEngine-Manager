# GameAudioEngine-Manager

## Introduction

Hello there! In this project, I wrapped the FMOD and Wwise APIs each in their own **Audio Manager** class.

Both [FMOD](https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.1&page=welcome.html) and the [Wwise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/fr/library/edge/?source=SDK&id=index.html) APIs provide their audio engine; the audio manager controls the calls to that engine.
The project shows the default implementation of the APIs and provides an environment in which to test the audio engines.

## Information

The project is built on macOS with CMake;

The [SFML API](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-osx.php) is employed to generate the game loop; following the installation instructions, install the API as a framework.
Copy the content of *Frameworks* to `/Library/Frameworks`.

FMOD and Wwise *libraries* and *header* files are contained in the **includes** folder.
It is required to extract the `lib.zip` within `./includes/Wwise`. (I am using the files to build the Wwise sound engine *Profile* Configuration)

The folder `./includes/Wwise/StreamManager` contains the default implementation files of the **StreamManager**.

**AKWAAPI_Test** folder contains the Wwise authoring tool project, containing the generated soundbanks and moreâ€¦

**Assets** folder contains royalty-free audio files used in the project. The files were downloaded from the [Game Audio GDC Archive](https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc/) and [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)

## Build 
All the files needed to build FMOD and Wwise audio engines are present in the **includes** folder.

The project should build two different configurations; one employs the FMOD engine and the other employs the Wwise engine. 
From within the project directory:

### FMOD
```
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug_fmod -DFMOD_D=1
cd cmake-build-debug_fmod
make
./GameAudioEngine 
```

### WWISE
```
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug_wwise -DWWISE_D=1 
cd cmake-build-debug_wwise
make 
./GameAudioEngine 
```

Each build defines a *preprocessor directive* macro, FMOD_D or WWISE_D that through conditional inclusions includes/excludes parts of the code of the corresponding build.
